I launched the landing page of VAnow.net - the webapp that sets you you up with a Realtime Certified Virtual Assistant or be one

  

I am currently looking for VAs and clients,Â gathering emails and checking out the market vefore building the whole system

  

I emailed Rob Walling about VAnow.net and here's his reaction:

_I like it. This is one of the ideas I was going to pursue a while back_

I don't want to sound like a crazy fan, but if the master of Micropreneurship likes it and thought about doing it himself - I'm happy :)

  

Rob also suggested I niche it at entrepreneurs - I think it's a great idea

Let me know about places where VAs and entrepreneurs hang out

And if you can think of something that might help - send me a message :)
