I use VA's (Virtual Assistant) a lot.  

It changed the way I do my tasks and deal my time.

But 24-72 hours Is sometimes too slow. I wish I had a place where I could hire a good VA from now to now, meaning immediately. I couldn't find a place like this. So I decided to build it - after receiving the market research from my VA, that is.

  

Second idea is a micro shift manager. It even has a name and a logo already!

It's a SaaS app that will automatically schedule employee shifts for small teams - cafes, kitchens, shops...

  

Later this week my lovely wife, who is a pastry chef, will show me how she manually schedules her bakery's employees shifts, based on her employees' preferences and the business' needs.
