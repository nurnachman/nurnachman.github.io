I attended a security meetup last night, and the presentation they gave really reinforced my understanding of how dangerous Flash is.

  

So I headed over to disabling Flash on my Chrome browser.

  

This is how it's done:

1\. Go to this URL : [chrome:plugins](//plugins/)

2\. Disable Flash

  

I hope this helps you in Disabling Flash in your Chrome Browser and may we all together bring Flash to the retirement phase together :)
