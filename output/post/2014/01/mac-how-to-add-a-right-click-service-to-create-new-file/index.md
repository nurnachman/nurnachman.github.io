I like the "New Text File" feature in the right-click menu in Microsoft Windows, and I want that in my mac.  
  
So here's how to add it:  
  
Installation:  
1\. [Download the package](http://bigundo.com/Create%20New%20File.zip)  
2\. Unzip it  
3\. Double click the file and say YES to install it.  
  
Use:  
1\. Right-click on a file or folder anywhere and click "Create New File"  
2\. Input a filename and click OK  
3\. Now you have a new file
