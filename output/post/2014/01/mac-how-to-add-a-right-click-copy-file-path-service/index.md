I was tired of having to open the file info pane and copy its path, so [I enhanced this Automator service](http://dmevolve.com/2011/11/copying-file-paths-in-mac-os-x/) to do just that.  
  
Installation:  
1\. [Download the Automator service](http://bigundo.com/Copy%20file%20path.zip)  
2\. Extract the zip file  
3\. Double click the file and say YES to install it  
  
Use:  
Simply right-click on a file and click "Copy file path"
