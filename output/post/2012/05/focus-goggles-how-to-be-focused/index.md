How many times did you have a task that needed your full attention and focus? How many times were you unable to get focused enough for the task? Let's not forget all the distractions from the environment...  

  

Focus Goggles to the rescue:

1\. Take 2 finished toilet paper rolls (only the cardboard, not the paper)

2\. Tape them on a pair of normal glasses

and you have a pair of Focus Goggles - all you see is the screen.
