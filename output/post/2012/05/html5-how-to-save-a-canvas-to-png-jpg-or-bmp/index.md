I want to save the contents of a canvas element to a file.  
[I came across this wonderful library for saving html5 canvas elements to image file](http://www.nihilogic.dk/labs/canvas2image/)  
  
You import 2 JS libraries, get the canvas from the DOM, and call this function:  
_Canvas2Image.saveAsPNG(canvas);_Â   
The user will get a save dialog.
