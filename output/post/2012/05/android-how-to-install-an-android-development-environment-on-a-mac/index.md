I want to install an Android development environment on my mac machine.  

  

1\. [Install JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-7u4-downloads-1591156.html) (Java SDK)

2\. [Install Eclipse](http://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/indigosr2) and extract it to a nice path (i.e. Home\\dev)

3\. [Download Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and extract it to a nice path (i.e. Home\\dev)  
4\. Install ADT (Android Developer Tools) in Eclipse:  

- Help
- Install new software
- Add: [https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/](https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/) (If unreachable, try http)
- Download all developer tools

5\. Exit Eclipse, Start Eclipse

6\. Choose the SDK's you want to install

7\. Wait while SDK's are downloaded and installed

8\. Restart Eclipse  
  
That's it!! Your mac is now an Android development workstation
