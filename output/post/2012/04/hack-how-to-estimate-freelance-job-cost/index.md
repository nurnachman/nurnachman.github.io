I started building apps for customers and businesses.  
I'm having a hard time to estimate the cost of each project.  
So here's a hack to help you estimate the price you want.  
  
1\. Open a user profile in a freelancers' marketplace (oDesk and rent a coder etc.)  
2\. Post a request for proposals, explaining your customer's request (without giving NDA data)  
3\. Wait a few days and get tons of proposals  
4\. Calculate an average of the proposals  
  
You now have a concrete number to play with.
