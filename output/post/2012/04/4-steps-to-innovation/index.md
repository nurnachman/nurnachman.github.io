**I heard a lecture that dealt with the question - “_can innovation be systematized?_”  
This post will show a 4-step system for creating new ideas.  
  
1\. Choose an existing product (or service or idea or song or code or a play or a movie)  
2\. Define the product’s properties in detail  
3\. Transform 1 of the properties (make it bigger, smaller, wider, taller, append it with another product, put it in a different context, change the material, etc..)  
4\. Repackage the mutated idea.  
  
Let’s do it together:  
  
1\. Choose: Clock  
2\. Define: A modern clock is an instrument that is hung on the wall and shows the time of the day using needles - for Hours, Minutes and Seconds.  
3\.  Transform: This is the fun part, where you can really go wild. Here are some optional ideas:  
hung on the wall -> hung on the wrist / placed in the pocket  
shows the time of the day -> shows the time since you woke up  
using needles -> using LEDs \\ projection \\ color code  
Hours, Minutes and Seconds -> “pomodoro intervals” (25 minutes work + 5 minutes rest)  
4\. Repackage: I chose one of the transformations (you can brainstorm endless combinations)  
The Pomodoro clock is an instrument that is hung on the wall and shows the time of work using needles - for Pomodoro intervals of 25 minutes of productive work and 5 minutes of playful rest  
  
It’s like scanning the DNA of a product, exposing it to some kind of radiation, and packaging the mutated DNA into a new product.**

**It's also a fun activity to go through some ideas and trying to see how are they a mutation of another product.**
