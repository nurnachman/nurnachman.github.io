**You can  
plan  
how to draw  
a straight line  
from point A to B  
  
and in 1 long stroke  
miss point B.  
  
While you were planning,  
point B already moved  
  
While you were planning,  
the plan became invalid.  
  
You can  
draw  
short strokes,  
tune the angle  
of each line  
  
and reach point B.**
