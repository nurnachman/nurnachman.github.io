## I wrote a bookmarklet that reads text out loud in your browser.

  
  
Simply drag this link to your bookmarks bar: Â 100){alert('too long, choose upto 100 chars');} else {window.open("http://translate.google.com/translate\_tts?tl=en&q=" + escape(document.getSelection()));}">read out loud  
  
To use the Text to Speech Bookmarklet:  
  

1. Select text in your browser
2. Cick the bookmarklet.
3. Then an mp3 will load and play. (Sometimes you need to refresh to make it load)

  
It uses the Google Translate TTS API, which is actually a hack-API. [Using the Google Text To Speech API is explained here](http://weston.ruter.net/projects/google-tts/).  
  
  

## I found it great for making phrases stick inside my brain.
