[I read a great book about gamification - Gamification by Design](http://www.amazon.com/Gamification-Design-Implementing-Mechanics-Mobile/dp/1449397670/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1314205307&sr=8-1) and decided to share some main points i drew from it.  
  

## What is Gamification?

  
Gamification is creating stronger engagement between your users and your product by applying game techniques.  
  
When we gamify a product, we call our product a game, and our users - players.  
  

## Traditional examples of Gamification

  

- Buy 9 coffees, get 1 free
- Earn points on purchases you make with your credit card and convert them to prizes
- Travel X thousands of miles with an airline and get extra services and advantages

## Modern examples of Gamification

  

- Foursquare and stackoverflow give you badges and points for achievements
- Farmville gives you the reward of seeing your crops grow

## Types of players

Most players play to socialize.  
  

## Flow

  
Flow is being "in the zone". Being completely focues and immersed in a task. It's the space between being challenged by the task and being adequately skilled to solve it.

We want our players to get into the flow in our game.  
  

## How to create a game loop

  
We create an achievable challenge and reward the player for achieving it. The challenge gets more difficult as the player advances.  
  

## What should be the first challenge I let my player achieve?

  
Welcome your players with a very achievable challenge. We don't want them to leave so soon..  
  

## What should I reward my player for achievements?

  
The best reward is status. Surprisingly, stuff as rewards are least effective for motivation.

  

I hope to implement these ideas in my apps and my word as I learn more about Gamification.
