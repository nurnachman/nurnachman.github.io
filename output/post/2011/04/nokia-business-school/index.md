What I learned in the past year, working as a Sales and Service Representative for Nokia.  
  

**Look sharp**  
Dress respectfully, smell good, and be polite.

**The Customer is Not God**  
In contrary to the saying, the customer is not always right. In some cases the customer is even knowingly wrong.  

  
**To conclude, I learned a lot from working at Nokia. I think everyone should work in sales and service for one year. It's a concentrated Business Course.**
