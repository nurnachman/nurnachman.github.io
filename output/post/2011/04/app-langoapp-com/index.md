LangO lets you write Hebrew and Russian. Everywhere, from any device.  
  
It's a mobile web app that allows users to write Hebrew and Russian using a variety of devices that doesn'tÂ necessarily have those languages as native writing languages.  
  
The user types English letters and LangO changes them to Hebrew\\Russian automatically.  
  
The user can click on his hardware keyboard or tap on the buttons with his touchscreen.
