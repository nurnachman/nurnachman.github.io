I was very happy to get an email from [HTML5games.de](http://html5games.de/)Â saying that they have played with my HTML5 game - 
  

[Letterman](http://lettermangame.com/)

  
liked it, and [posted a review](http://html5games.de/en/spiele/letterman/)!  
  
It's a great website to watch for the new upcoming media of HTML5 and specifically games.
